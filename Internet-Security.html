 <h1 id="indice1">Internet security</h1>
   <p>Internet security is a branch of computer security specifically related to not only Internet, often involving browser security and the World Wide Web, but also network security as it applies to other applications or operating systems as a whole.</p>
 <h2 id="indice2">Difference between Pasive and Active security threats</h2>
   <h3 id="subindice2.1">What is active attack?</h3>
     <p>Active attacks are attacks in which the hacker attempts to change or transform the content of messages or information. These attacks are a threat to the integrity and availability of the system. Due to these attacks, systems get damaged, and information can be altered. 
        The good thing about this type of attack is that the victim is notified about the attack.</p>
   <h3 id="subindice2.1">What is Passive attack?</h3>
     <p>Passive attacks are the ones in which the attacker observes all the messages and copy the content of messages or information. They focus on monitoring all the transmission and gaining the data. The attacker does not try to change any data or information he gathered. Although there is no potential harm to the system due to these attacks, they can be a significant danger to your data’s confidentiality. 
        Unlike the Active attacks, these are difficult to detect as it does not involve alteration in data or information. Thus, the victim doesn’t get any idea about the attack.</p>
   <h3 id="subindice2.1">Examples:</h3>
     <h4><strong>Passive attacks</strong></h4>
 <ul>
     <li>The attackers try to scan a device to find vulnerabilities such as weak operating system or open ports.</li>
	 <li>The hackers analyze and monitor a website’s traffic to see who is visiting it. </li>
 </ul>
     <h4><strong>Active attacks</strong></h4>
 <ul>
     <li>The attacker is inserting his data into the original data stream.</li>
	 <li>Man-in-the-middle attack where the attacker sits between both parties communicating and replacing their messages with his message. In other words, both parties believe that they are talking to each other, but in reality, they are talking to the attacker.</li>
 </ul>
 <h3 id="subindice2.1">Types</h3>
    <h4>The active attacks are divided into three types:</h4>
 <ul>
    <li><strong>Interruption:</strong> These attacks are also known as masquerade attacks, where an unlawful attacker tries to show themselves as another identity. </li>
	<li><strong>Modification:</strong>These attacks can be done in two ways, replay attack and alteration. Replay attacks are the ones in which a sequence of events are captured and resent by the attacker. Simultaneously, alteration attacks are the ones in which some changes are done in original messages.</li>
	<li><strong>Fabrication:</strong> These attacks cause Denial of service attacks in which the attackers try to prevent legal users from preventing access to some services. In other words, the attacker gains access to the activities, and the permitted users are prohibited from using the services.</li>
 </ul>
    <h4>The passive attacks can be further classified into two types:</h4>
 <ul>
    <li><strong>The release of information:</strong> It can be somewhat understood by the example, where a sender sends a confidential message to the receiver, seen by an attacker. </li>
	<li><strong>Traffic analysis:</strong> In this attack, the sender sends a message in encrypted form to the receiver. The hacker analyses the traffic and observes the pattern to decrypt the message. These types of attacks are called traffic analysis. </li>
</ul>

	<h2 id="indice3">Malware</h2>
	 <h3 id="subindice3.1">Definition:</h3>
	  <p>Malware is any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network. A wide variety of malware types exist, including computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, rogue software, wiper and scareware.</p>
	 <h3 id="subindice3.2">Worm</h3>
	  <p>A computer worm is a type of malware that spreads copies of itself from computer to computer. A worm can replicate itself without any human interaction, and it does not need to attach itself to a software program in order to cause damage.</p>
	  <div align="center"><img src="https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/worm-picture-id469274932" alt="Malware worm" width="80%" height="400" width="200"></div>
	 <h3 id="subindice3.3">Trojan</h3>
	  <p>A Trojan horse or Trojan is a type of malware that is often disguised as legitimate software. Trojans can be employed by cyber-thieves and hackers trying to gain access to users' systems. Users are typically tricked by some form of social engineering into loading and executing Trojans on their systems. Once activated, Trojans can enable cyber-criminals to spy on you, steal your sensitive data, and gain backdoor access to your system.</p>

     <h3 id="subindice3.4">Virus</h3>
	  <p>Is a piece of computer code that inserts itself within the code of another standalone program, then forces that program to take malicious action and spread itself.</p>
	  <div align="center"><img src="https://www.doctorclic.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/malware-virus-diferencias.png" alt="Malware Virus" width="80%" height="400" width="200"></div>
	 <h3 id="subindice3.5">Spyware</h3>
	  <p>Spyware is unwanted software that infiltrates your computing device, stealing your internet usage data and sensitive information. Spyware is classified as a type of malware — malicious software designed to gain access to or damage your computer, often without your knowledge. Spyware gathers your personal information and relays it to advertisers, data firms, or external users.</p>

	<h2 id="indice4">Software and hardware to protect networks</h2>
	 <h3 id="subindice4.1">What is Network Security?</h3>
	  <p>Network Security protects your network and data from breaches, intrusions and other threats. This is a vast and overarching term that describes hardware and software solutions as well as processes or rules and configurations relating to network use, accessibility, and overall threat protection.
         Network Security involves access control, virus and antivirus software, application security, network analytics, types of network-related security (endpoint, web, wireless), firewalls, VPN encryption and more.</p>
	 <h3 id="subindice4.2">Sotfware</h3>
	  <p>Network security software are tools that track and prevent unauthorized access or denial of network resources through phishing, Trojan horses, spyware, worms, and other vendor-specific vulnerabilities. ... However, network security has become a more pressing issue for SMBs as more processes become digital or cloud-based.</p>
	 <h3 id="subindice4.3">Hardware</h3>
	  <p>Firewalls. Firewalls are hardware appliances and software programs that act as a barrier between incoming traffic and the network. The firewall compares data packets that are sent over the network to predefined policies and rules that indicate whether or not the data should be permitted into the network.</p>
	<h2 id="indice5">Network protocols</h2>
	 <h3 id="subindice5.1">What is a Network Protocol</h3>
	  <p>A network protocol is an established set of rules that determine how data is transmitted between different devices in the same network. Essentially, it allows connected devices to communicate with each other, regardless of any differences in their internal processes, structure or design. Network protocols are the reason you can easily communicate with people all over the world, and thus play a critical role in modern digital communications.</p>

	 <h3 id="subindice5.2"><strong>SSL</strong></h3>
	  <p>SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer, is an encryption-based Internet security protocol. It was first developed by Netscape in 1995 for the purpose of ensuring privacy, authentication, and data integrity in Internet communications. SSL is the predecessor to the modern TLS encryption used today.</p>
	 <h3 id="subindice5.3"><strong>HTTPS</strong></h3>
	  <p>HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. It is the protocol where encrypted HTTP data is transferred over a secure connection. By using secure connection such as Transport Layer Security or Secure Sockets Layer, the privacy and integrity of data are maintained and authentication of websites is also validated.</p>

	 <h3 id="subindice5.4"><strong>IPv6</strong></h3>
	  <p>Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol (IP), the communications protocol that provides an identification and location system for computers on networks and routes traffic across the Internet. IPv6 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to deal with the long-anticipated problem of IPv4 address exhaustion.</p>
	<h2 id="indice6">Digital certificates and certificate authorities</h2>
	 <h3>Definition:</h3>
	  <p>Digital certificates are issued by trusted parties, called certificate authorities, to verify the identity of an entity, such as a client or server. The digital certificate serves two purposes: it verifies the owner's identity and it makes the owner's public key available.</p>
