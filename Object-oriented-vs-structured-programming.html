   <h1> OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING VS STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING</h1>
   
    <h2> Object Oriented Programming </h2>
   <p> Object-Oriented Programming, as name suggests, is a different approach to programming that brings together data and functions that execute on them. It basically supports encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, etc. It also includes data hiding feature therefore it is more secure. This model is based on real life entities that focuses on by whom task is to be done rather than focusing on what to do.<br>

       Example : JAVA, C#, C++, etc. </p>
   <h2> Structured Programming </h2> 
   <p> Structured Programming, as name suggests, is a technique that is considered as precursor to OOP and usually consists of well-structured and separated modules. In this programming, user can create its own user-defined functions as well as this methodology tries to resolve issues that are associated with unconditional transfers to allow programmers follow logic of programs. It also requires more discipline at the design and logical structing stage.<br>

       Example : Pascal, ALGOL, C, Modula-2, etc. </p>
